   - **Create Bootable Media:** Use tools like **Rufus** or **Etcher** to create a bootable USB drive or prepare virtual machine images.
   - **Boot and Install:**  
     - **Partitioning:** Allocate disk space appropriately, considering separate partitions for `/home`, `/var`, `/tmp`, and `/opt` if needed.
     - **Network Configuration:** Assign static IP addresses for servers to ensure consistent network communication.
     - **User Accounts:** Create administrative and regular user accounts with appropriate permissions.

3. **Post-Installation Configuration:**
